                “The breaking of the high-level German codes began with the efforts of the Polish secret service in the interwar period. By creating a copy of the basic German enciphering machine, the Poles managed to read German signal traffic throughout the 1930s with varying degrees of success. However, shortly before the Munich conference in September 1938, the Germans made alterations to their enciphering machine–the so-called Enigma machine–and in mid-September, darkness closed over German message traffic.”<br>

To the east lay Russia, a nation ambitions to spread its communism, and to the west lay Germany, desperate to regain territory ceded to Poland after the war. Sandwiched between these two enemies, the Poles were desperate for intelligence information, and they formed a new cipher bureau, the Biuro Szyfrów. If necessity is the mother of invention, then perhaps adversity is the mother of cryptanalysis... Their monitoring of German communications had been… effective, until 1926, when they too encountered the Enigma messages.” <br>

                “In charge of deciphering the German messages [for Poland] was Captain Maksymilian Ciezki… Ciezki had access to a commercial version of the Enigma machine, which revealed all the principles of Scherbius’s invention. Unfortunately, the commercial version was distinctly different from the military one in terms or the wirings inside each scrambler.” Later, intelligence from a spy, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, gave Poland the wirings of the military machine. <br>

                “For centuries, it had been assumed that the best cryptanalysts were experts in the structure of language, but the arrival of Enigma prompted the Poles to alter their recruiting policy. Enigma was a mechanical cipher, and the Biuro Szyfrów reasoned that a scientific mind might stand a better chance of breaking it.” Twenty mathematicians from a once German university, therefore fluent in German, were selected and sworn to secrecy. Three that showed skill in cryptanalysis, including Marian Rejewski, were invited into the Biuro Szyfrów, the Polish code-breaking center.<br>

                In 1932 and 1933, Marian Rejewski used photographs and an operating manual from French Intelligence to deduce the wiring of the Enigma Machine. He learned Enigma operators set the three wheels inside to specific starting positions that other operators were informed of. Positions were set in place before the message was enciphered and he produced a method to find those starting positions, the Bomba. <sup>1</sup> The Bomba “was at first an electro-mechanical and later an electronic computer that was aimed to adjust itself to whatever alterations the Germans might make in the… Enigma mechanism… By 1937 its Polish inventors had improved it to a point where, for a time, they read three-fourths of all Enigma messages.” <sup>2</sup> However, in May 1940, the Enigma Machine underwent a major change so Rejewski’s method no longer worked. <sup>1</sup><br>

The Poles, in fact, favored a single facility to include the British, but on this the French were adamantly negative. There was, however, an exchange of technical data and deciphered messages with the central British decrypting establishment at Bletchley Park, where the British worked by themselves until the Americans joined them after entering the war late in 1941.”<br>

He attempted to become a businessman, but his soap factory was forced to close because of the postwar depression and hyperinflation... The humiliation of Schmidt’s failures was compounded by the success of his elder brother, Rudolph, who had also fought in the war, and retained in the army afterward... He was [eventually] responsible for ensuring secure communications and in fact it was Rudolph who officially sanctioned the army’s use of the Enigma cipher. After [Schmidt’s] business collapsed… Rudolph arranged a job for him in Berlin at the Chiffrierstelle", the department dealing with Enigma. Starting his new job, Schmidt moved to “expensive Berlin, impoverished and isolated, envious of his perfect brother and resentful toward a nation which had rejected him. The result was inevitable. By selling secret Enigma information to foreign powers. Hans-Thilo Schmidt could earn money and gain revente, damagins his country’s security and undermining his brother’s organization.” <br>

                “The case officer assigned to Schmidt was another German citizen working for the French and using the name Lemoine, code named 'Rex', who would meet with Schmidt to obtain the information he provided, including daily Enigma ciphers for certain months.” <sup>1</sup> On November 8, 1931, “in exchange for” $30,000 as of today, Schmidt allowed Rex to photograph two documents [that] were essentially instructions for using the Enigma machine, and although there was no explicit description of the wirings inside each scrambler, they contained the information needed to deduce those wirings.” <sup>2</sup> Unable to shake the French Cipher Section of the Army General Staff from its lethargy and ignorance of the threat presented by the complex German encryption capability, French Intelligence officers passed the information on to the Polish Biuro Szyfrów [sic]” <sup>1</sup> to support an agreement of military cooperation the French and Polish signed earlier. <sup>2</sup> “With the help of Schmidt’s pilfered ciphers, the brilliant Polish mathematician and cryptologist Marian Rejewski was able to provide the calculations needed to successfully replicate an Enigma machine in early 1933. Thereafter, work began in earnest to develop further calculations that would enable the machine to actually decipher intercepted German messages, but it was an excruciatingly slow process that would only begin to come close to its goal in 1937 with the refining of an electromechanical process known as the ‘Bomba’” <sup>1</sup> <br>

                Although she isn’t as well known, Joan Clarke’s work was important, as for many other women. While the work many women did at Ultra was pivotal in the mission of solving the Enigma codes, women at the time didn’t get the well-deserved recognition for their work.

                “A basic flaw in the design of Enigma was that no letter of the alphabet could ever be represented by itself once enciphered - a could never be a, z could never be z. Together with errors in sent messages and the German habit of using standard phrases at the start of each communication, this allowed cryptanalysts to establish informed ‘guesses’. Nevertheless, without a swift mechanical deciphering system, Enigma’s 150,000,000,000,000,000,000 combinations were practically unbreakable.”<br>

                Besides the flaws of the machine, human error also contributed to the Allies’ success. “For each message, the operator was supposed to select a different message key, three letters chosen at random. However, in the heat of battle, rather than straining their imaginations to pick a random key, the overworked operators would sometimes pick three consecutive letters from the Enigma keyboard… These predictable message keys became known as cillies.” Operators occasionally used the same key multiple times. That’s why codebreakers would check the cillies every day.<br>

                The Nazis also implemented rules that supposedly would make the Enigma harder to crack, but actually reduced the permutations. “Excluding certain arrangements to avoid a scrambler remaining in the same position meant that the codebook compilers reduced by half the number of possible scrambler arrangements.” When arrangements were deducted for one day, they could eliminate half the arrangements during the next day. Another rule was “that the plugboard settings could not include a swap between any letter and its neighbor, which meant that S could be swapped with any letter except R and T.” Although this avoided obvious settings, it eliminated many possibilities.<br>

                These loopholes gave Bletchley Park a starting point, and eliminated possibilities that saved them time, also helping improve code-breaking technology like the Bombe.

                “Some keys would be broken within 2-4 hours, some would never be broken – speed was always of the essence… At [Bletchley] Park, Alan Turing was asked to find a way to break Enigma messages. Because of changes to the German operating procedures and the introduction of extra wheels, the Polish Bomba was now obsolete… Throughout the war the operation built around 211 Bombe machines and broke many keys on a daily basis. Huge amounts of intercepted traffic were deciphered, supplying invaluable information about enemy operations… The first Turing/Welchman Bombe based machine, known as Agnus Dei or simply Agnes, became operational in August 1940.” <br>

                The Enigma Machine was built “with nearly 12 miles of wiring and 97,000 carefully machined parts.”<br>

                “It was the task of the Bombe to discover the daily key - wheel order, wheel settings and plugboard configuration - to enable the 3-5,000 Enigma messages intercepted each day to be deciphered" <sup>1</sup> by searching “through different possible positions of Enigma’s internal wheels, looking for a pattern of keyboard-to-lamp board connections that would turn coded letters into plain German. The method depended on human instinct, though; to initiate the process, a code breaker had to guess a few words in the message (these guessed words were called a crib). The Polish Bomba, a simpler 18-drum machine, was a forerunner of the Bombe, but it was based on Rejewski’s method for finding the wheel positions at the start of the message. Unlike Rejewski’s method, the more powerful crib-based method invented by Turing survived the May 1940 change. <sup>2</sup>”<br>
